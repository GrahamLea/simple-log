<p>
<b><font size="+1"><font size="+2">S</font>imple <font size="+2">L</font>og</font></b>
is logging anti-framework.<br>
I have written it in protest against the many "logging frameworks" that are available and
recommended by many developers.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Simple Log is a small library that does logging very simply and requires you to do almost nothing
(other than actually logging) to get log output happening.<br>
It doesn't attempt to solve every logging problem in one package, but I believe it will be suitable
for at least 80% of applications that need logging.<br>
I find it much simpler to use than a logging framework, especially in terms of configuration.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Simple Log is a true "Tiny Tool".<br>
With only 3 classes in a 17.5K JAR, this tool will handle the logging needs of most small- to
medium-sized projects, but with an almost non-existent learning curve.

The rest of this page is a summary of the features and use of Simple Log.<br>
You can read more about the details in the <a href="nonav/api/index.html">API Documentation</a>.
</p>


<h3>Features</h3>

<p>
Here are some of the features of Simple Log:
<ul>
   <li>A very simple API (3 classes).</li>
   <li>"Brief" API (i.e short methods names).</li>
   <li>Fast-failing for unlogged messages.</li>
   <li>Support for three debug types: debug message, debug object and debug exception.</li>
   <li>Support for tracing: entry and exit.</li>
   <li>Seven debug levels: Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Verbose, Ludicrous.</li>
   <li>Ability to switch tracing on and off independent of the debug level.</li>
   <li>Package-based, hierarchical inheritance of debug levels and trace flags.</li>
   <li>Minimal configuration that is easy to write, understand and maintain.</li>
   <li>Special printing of exceptions, object arrays, byte arrays and char arrays.</li>
   <li>Reloading configuration (optional).</li>
   <li>Customisable log format.</li>
   <li>Customisable log date format.</li>
   <li>Instance-based logging records.</li>
   <li>Configurable through code, while running.</li>
   <li>17.5 KB distributable JAR</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Here are some of the features Simple Log <b>does not</b> contain (on purpose):
<ul>
   <li>
      An XML Configuration File.<br>
      <i>The properties configuration file is simple and easier to read and maintain than XML.</i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
   <li>
      Any concept of a "Logging Pipeline" or "Log Event" objects.<br>
      <i>As well as consuming memory unnecessarily, such architectures are overkill for the simple
      level-based logging that most applications require.</i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
   <li>
      Extendable Debug Levels<br>
      <i>Really, is seven not enough!?</i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
   <li>
      Custom Filters<br>
      <i>All messages are either logged or not based on the level of the message compared to the
      level assigned to the class that created it. If you need something fancier, this is not the
      package for you.</i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
   <li>
      Custom Formatters/Renderers<br>
      <i>The format of log messages can be controlled, from the properties file, using the extremely
      flexible java.text.MessageFormat.</i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
   <li>
      A 200-page Manual<br>
      <i>If you can't understand the javadoc for 3 classes, you probably shouldn't be programming.
      </i>
   </li>
      <br>
      <br>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Sample Code</h3>

<h4>Creating a Logger</h4>

<p>
To use Simple Log, you just create a SimpleLogger at the top of your class, like this:<pre>
   private static final SimpleLogger log = new SimpleLogger(HelloWorld.class);
</pre>
and then use that logger through your class.<br>
</p>

<h4>Using a Logger</h4>

<p>Here's an example of how you might use Simple Log:<pre>
public class
HelloWorld
{
   <b>// Create a SimpleLogger:</b>
   private static final SimpleLogger log = new SimpleLogger(HelloWorld.class);

   public static void
   main(String[] argv)
   {
      try
      {
         <b>// Use it!</b>
         log.entry("main()");
         log.debug("About to print 'Hello World!'");
         String helloWorldString = "'Hello World!'";
         log.dbo(DebugLevel.L6_VERBOSE, "helloWorldString", helloWorldString);
         log.db(DebugLevel.L7_LUDICROUS,
                "I can't believe this library has a level called 'Ludicrous'!");

         System.out.println(helloWorldString);

         log.debug("Printed 'Hello World!'");
         log.info("Did you get that?");
         log.warn("This example is very contrived.");
      }
      catch (Throwable t)
      {
         // Just in case...
         log.fatal("Something really unexpected dropped by.");
         log.dbe(DebugLevel.L1_FATAL, t);
      }
      log.exit("main()");
   }
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<p>
The default output from running the class (with it's debug level set to 7 and tracing on) follows.
<br>
Remember that the format of the output is configurable.<pre>
<font size="-2">
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|&gt;&gt;&gt;|main|HelloWorld|main()
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|   |main|HelloWorld|About to print 'Hello World!'
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|---|main|HelloWorld|helloWorldString|'Hello World!'
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|   |main|HelloWorld|I can't believe this library has a level called 'Ludicrous'!
'Hello World!'
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|   |main|HelloWorld|Printed 'Hello World!'
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|   |main|HelloWorld|Did you get that?
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|   |main|HelloWorld|This example is very contrived.
Fri 26/10/2004 21:10:32.618|&lt;&lt;&lt;|main|HelloWorld|main()
</font>
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>
Simple Log is configured simply by having a file called 'simpelog.properties' in the classpath.<br>
An empty file will be enough to get you logging at the Info level for all classes.<br>
The example properties file that comes with the release contains documentation about all the
properties that can be used to configure Simple Log.<br>
You can <a href="release/simplelog.properties" target="_blank">view it here</a>.
