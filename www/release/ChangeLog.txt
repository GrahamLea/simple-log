                        - Property 'simplelog.logFile' now supports date substitution, controlled by
                          property 'simplelog.logFile.interpretName'
                        - Added property 'simplelog.logFile.append' to allow overwriting of file
   + Issue 7: (RFE): Added SimpleLogger convenience methods:
                        - fatalException(Throwable)
                        - errorException(Throwable)
                        - warnException(Throwable)
                        - infoObject(String,Object|boolean|int)
                        - debugObject(String,Object|boolean|int)
                        - verboseObject(String,Object|boolean|int)
   + Issue 8: (BUG): Level properties with trailing whitespace cause errors
   + The dbo(DebugLevel,String,Object) method now routes to the corresponding Object[], byte[] and
     char[] variations if the object value is of those types
