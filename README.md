Simple Log: A logging anti-framework
====================================

Simple Log is a small (very small!) Java logging library that I wrote during a university project and released as open source in the early 2000s.

I called it an "anti-framework", because it is an alternative to logging frameworks that contain tons of features that most people have no use for. As I wrote in the user guide page on the philosophy behind Simple Log:

Though it hasn't been changed in almost a decade, it is still a very useful alternative for small applications or tools that need to do simple logging, or environments that specifically need a very small binary.

> I started with a list of things that I didn't want to do. I didn't want to do them because I'd seen them done in other logging libraries and they annoyed me a lot.

What Simple Log lacks in features, it makes up for with a comprehensive and witty user guide.
