Simple Log: A logging anti-framework
====================================

Simple Log is a small (very small!) Java logging library that I wrote during a university project and maintained until 2006.

It called it an "anti-framework", because it is an alternative to logging frameworks that contain tons of features that most people have no use for. As I wrote in the user guide page on the philosophy behind Simple Log:

> I started with a list of things that I didn't want to do. I didn't want to do them because I'd seen them done in other logging libraries and they annoyed me a lot.

What Simple Log lacks in features, it makes up for with a comprehensive and witty user guide.
